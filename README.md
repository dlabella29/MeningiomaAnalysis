To run the AuthorAffiliationListGenerator.py, you'll need a .xlsx file that has column A - H as such:
Overall order;	First Name;	Middle Name(s);	Last Name;	Affiliation 1 name;	Affiliation 2 name;	Affiliation 3 name;	Affiliation 4 name
The overall order is the desired order of the authors.
Each author will have their own row starting on row 2. Row 1 reserved for the column headers as specified above.

Overall order	First Name	Middle Name(s)	Last Name	Affiliation 1 name	Affiliation 2 name	Affiliation 3 name	Affiliation 4 name
1	Dominic	 	LaBella	Duke University Medical Center, Department of Radiation Oncology, Durham, NC, USA			
121	Evan	 	Calabrese	Duke University Medical Center, Department of Radiology, Durham, NC, USA	University of California San Francisco, CA, USA
