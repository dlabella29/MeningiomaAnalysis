To run the AuthorAffiliationListGenerator.py, you'll need a .xlsx file that has column A - H as such:
Overall order;	First Name;	Middle Name(s);	Last Name;	Affiliation 1 name;	Affiliation 2 name;	Affiliation 3 name;	Affiliation 4 name
The overall order is the desired order of the authors.
Each author will have their own row starting on row 2. Row 1 reserved for the column headers as specified above.
